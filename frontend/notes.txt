Quick tip: you can have a browser window within vs code. 
Copy the localhost URL, open command palette (ctrl+shift+P), 
type 'simple browser' then enter and paste your URL. Now it 
opens another tab with your website in it. To have it side 
by side press ctrl + \ then drag and drop the browser tab to 
the right. It will make alt tabbing and resizing windows much 
easier.
